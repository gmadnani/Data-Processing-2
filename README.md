# Data-Processing-2

## Objectives
The objectives of this assignment are
1. To practice a further selection of techniques discussed in lectures and workshops, in-
cluding clustering, correlations and predictions.
2. To practice using a widely used Python library for data processing - pandas and a widely
used library for prediction and clustering scikit-learn.
3. To gain experience using library functions which are unfamiliar and which require con-
sultation of additional documentation from resources on the Web.

## Background
In this project you will further practice your Python wrangling skills with the same publicly
available dataset used in Project 1. The dataset is the food nutrient database from Food
Standards Australia and New Zealand1 in the le food nutrient 2011 13 AHS.csv. It contains
a detailed breakdown of nutrient values for a wide range of food items. Each nutrient value
is presented on a per 100 gram edible portion basis. It was used to support the 2011-13
Australian Health Survey.
* food nutrient 2011 13 AHS.csv: Nutrient information for about 5.7k foods.

Key libraries to use are Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, seaborn and sklearn. You
will need to write Python 3 code (Jupyter notebook).
